**Playbook ID:** PLAY-000017  •  **Category:** AI

## Executive Summary

A repeatable, automatable workflow for **MCP Integration**. Model Context Protocol: a standard way to expose tools, resources and data to AI agents securely and consistently. It is executable by human teams and AI agents with clear human-approval points.

## Business Objective

Make mcp integration consistent, fast, safe and auditable across the enterprise.

## Scope

Covers the end-to-end mcp integration workflow. Out-of-scope concerns are delegated to their own playbooks.

## Trigger Conditions

- New agent capability
- New system to expose

## Preconditions

- Required inputs, access and approvals are available.
- Relevant rules and checklists are known.

## Inputs

- The request/context that triggered the workflow.
- Relevant data, artefacts and configuration.

## Outputs

- The completed outcome of the workflow.
- Evidence, audit trail and any follow-up actions.

## Roles Responsible

- MCP Engineer
- Security
- Team

## AI Agents Involved

- Task agent(s) that execute eligible steps.
- Reviewer/evaluator agent that checks outputs.
- Orchestrator that coordinates and escalates.

## Human Approval Points

- Before any high-risk or irreversible action.
- At the final approval/sign-off step.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow proceeds through 4 main steps with a decision point that routes high-risk actions to human approval.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

| Step | Actor | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | MCP Engineer | Design tool schema and permissions. |
| 2 | MCP Engineer | Implement auth and validation. |
| 3 | Security | Review for least privilege and misuse. |
| 4 | Team | Publish, version and monitor. |

## Decision Branches

- If the action is high-risk or irreversible -> require human approval.
- If validation fails -> remediate and repeat the step.
- If blocked -> follow the escalation path.

## Exception Handling

- Capture the error and context.
- Apply the documented fallback or safe-stop.
- Open an incident if customer impact is possible.

## Escalation Path

Owner -> domain lead -> Governance Division, with severity-based timelines.

## Required Skills

Executed by holders of the relevant [Specialist Skills](../../PHASE_05_SKILLS/README.md).

## Required Rules

Must comply with the [Enterprise Rules](../../PHASE_06_RULES/README.md).

## Required Checklists

Validated using the [Enterprise Checklists](../../PHASE_07_CHECKLISTS/README.md).

## Required Templates

Uses the [Enterprise Templates](../../PHASE_09_TEMPLATES/README.md).

## Required Knowledge Articles

Background in the [Enterprise Knowledge base](../../PHASE_10_KNOWLEDGE/README.md).

## Automation Opportunities

- Automate repeatable steps and validations in CI/CD or workflows.
- Use AI agents for drafting, triage and checks.
- Auto-collect evidence and update tracking systems.

## Integration Points

- GitHub / GitLab (code, PRs, actions).
- Jira / Linear (tracking).
- Slack / Teams (notifications).
- Vercel / cloud (deploy).
- n8n / Make (orchestration).

## KPIs

- Tool reliability
- Permission incidents
- Audit coverage

## SLAs

- Acknowledge triggers within 1 business day.
- Complete standard runs within the agreed target time.
- Resolve exceptions per severity SLA.

## Risks

- Over-privileged tools let agents cause harm.

## Best Practices

- Least privilege.
- Gate risky actions.
- Audit everything.

## Anti-patterns

- Over-broad tool permissions.
- Unauthenticated tools.
- No audit trail.

## Definition of Done

- Outcome achieved and validated.
- Audit trail recorded.
- Follow-up actions tracked.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All steps completed or consciously skipped with reason.
- Required checklist passed.
- Approvals obtained.

## Post-Implementation Review

Review outcomes against objectives; capture lessons and improvement actions.

## Continuous Improvement

Feed metrics and lessons back into this playbook; update on a regular cadence.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Trigger and preconditions verified.
- [ ] Steps executed in order with evidence.
- [ ] Human approval obtained for high-risk actions.
- [ ] Required checklist passed.
