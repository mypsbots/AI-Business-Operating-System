**Playbook ID:** PLAY-000015  •  **Category:** AI

## Executive Summary

A repeatable, automatable workflow for **RAG Development**. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: grounding LLM answers in retrieved knowledge so they are accurate, current and citable. It is executable by human teams and AI agents with clear human-approval points.

## Business Objective

Make rag development consistent, fast, safe and auditable across the enterprise.

## Scope

Covers the end-to-end rag development workflow. Out-of-scope concerns are delegated to their own playbooks.

## Trigger Conditions

- New knowledge source
- Quality issue
- Scheduled refresh

## Preconditions

- Required inputs, access and approvals are available.
- Relevant rules and checklists are known.

## Inputs

- The request/context that triggered the workflow.
- Relevant data, artefacts and configuration.

## Outputs

- The completed outcome of the workflow.
- Evidence, audit trail and any follow-up actions.

## Roles Responsible

- RAG Engineer
- Team

## AI Agents Involved

- Task agent(s) that execute eligible steps.
- Reviewer/evaluator agent that checks outputs.
- Orchestrator that coordinates and escalates.

## Human Approval Points

- Before any high-risk or irreversible action.
- At the final approval/sign-off step.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow proceeds through 4 main steps with a decision point that routes high-risk actions to human approval.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

| Step | Actor | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | RAG Engineer | Ingest, chunk and embed sources. |
| 2 | RAG Engineer | Build retrieval + re-ranking. |
| 3 | RAG Engineer | Evaluate grounding and retrieval quality. |
| 4 | Team | Deploy; monitor and refresh. |

## Decision Branches

- If the action is high-risk or irreversible -> require human approval.
- If validation fails -> remediate and repeat the step.
- If blocked -> follow the escalation path.

## Exception Handling

- Capture the error and context.
- Apply the documented fallback or safe-stop.
- Open an incident if customer impact is possible.

## Escalation Path

Owner -> domain lead -> Governance Division, with severity-based timelines.

## Required Skills

Executed by holders of the relevant [Specialist Skills](../../PHASE_05_SKILLS/README.md).

## Required Rules

Must comply with the [Enterprise Rules](../../PHASE_06_RULES/README.md).

## Required Checklists

Validated using the [Enterprise Checklists](../../PHASE_07_CHECKLISTS/README.md).

## Required Templates

Uses the [Enterprise Templates](../../PHASE_09_TEMPLATES/README.md).

## Required Knowledge Articles

Background in the [Enterprise Knowledge base](../../PHASE_10_KNOWLEDGE/README.md).

## Automation Opportunities

- Automate repeatable steps and validations in CI/CD or workflows.
- Use AI agents for drafting, triage and checks.
- Auto-collect evidence and update tracking systems.

## Integration Points

- GitHub / GitLab (code, PRs, actions).
- Jira / Linear (tracking).
- Slack / Teams (notifications).
- Vercel / cloud (deploy).
- n8n / Make (orchestration).

## KPIs

- Faithfulness
- Retrieval recall/precision
- Citation accuracy

## SLAs

- Acknowledge triggers within 1 business day.
- Complete standard runs within the agreed target time.
- Resolve exceptions per severity SLA.

## Risks

- Ungrounded RAG hallucinates and misinforms.

## Best Practices

- Hybrid search + rerank.
- Evaluate grounding.
- Refresh content.

## Anti-patterns

- Answering without citations.
- Never refreshing the index.
- Ignoring retrieval quality.

## Definition of Done

- Outcome achieved and validated.
- Audit trail recorded.
- Follow-up actions tracked.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All steps completed or consciously skipped with reason.
- Required checklist passed.
- Approvals obtained.

## Post-Implementation Review

Review outcomes against objectives; capture lessons and improvement actions.

## Continuous Improvement

Feed metrics and lessons back into this playbook; update on a regular cadence.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Trigger and preconditions verified.
- [ ] Steps executed in order with evidence.
- [ ] Human approval obtained for high-risk actions.
- [ ] Required checklist passed.
