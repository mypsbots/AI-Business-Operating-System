## Executive Summary

A repeatable, automatable workflow for **Strategy Review**. A clear, accountable way to make, record and communicate decisions at the right level with the right input. It is executable by human teams and AI agents with clear human-approval points.

## Business Objective

Make strategy review consistent, fast, safe and auditable across the enterprise.

## Scope

Covers the end-to-end strategy review workflow. Out-of-scope concerns are delegated to their own playbooks.

## Trigger Conditions

- A request to perform strategy review
- A scheduled cycle

## Preconditions

- Required inputs, access and approvals are available.
- Relevant rules and checklists are known.

## Inputs

- The request/context that triggered the workflow.
- Relevant data, artefacts and configuration.

## Outputs

- The completed outcome of the workflow.
- Evidence, audit trail and any follow-up actions.

## Roles Responsible

- Approver
- Owner
- Reviewer
- Team / AI agent

## AI Agents Involved

- Task agent(s) that execute eligible steps.
- Reviewer/evaluator agent that checks outputs.
- Orchestrator that coordinates and escalates.

## Human Approval Points

- Before any high-risk or irreversible action.
- At the final approval/sign-off step.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow proceeds through 4 main steps with a decision point that routes high-risk actions to human approval.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

| Step | Actor | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Owner | Initiate strategy review and confirm preconditions. |
| 2 | Team / AI agent | Perform the core strategy review work. |
| 3 | Reviewer | Validate against the relevant checklist and rules. |
| 4 | Approver | Approve; record outcome and audit trail. |

## Decision Branches

- If the action is high-risk or irreversible -> require human approval.
- If validation fails -> remediate and repeat the step.
- If blocked -> follow the escalation path.

## Exception Handling

- Capture the error and context.
- Apply the documented fallback or safe-stop.
- Open an incident if customer impact is possible.

## Escalation Path

Owner -> domain lead -> Governance Division, with severity-based timelines.
